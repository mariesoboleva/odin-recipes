    <h2>Best Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo</h2>
    
    <p>This is a classic Italian-American dish that needs to be in every single kitchen. My Fettuccine Alfredo Recipe and Skinny Fettuccine Alfredo Recipe (with 75% less fat) are some of the most popular recipes on my Modern Honey. So I decided to add some protein by adding some sliced chicken breast!</p>

    <p>It all starts with a homemade alfredo sauce made with butter, garlic, heavy cream, and parmesan cheese tossed with fettuccine pasta. It is topped with seasoned sauteed chicken breast.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. Fettuccine Alfredo (I prefer to use fresh, refrigerated fettuccine pasta)</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons Salted Butter</li>
        <li>1 Garlic Clove (minced)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups Parmesan Cheese (high-quality, grated)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Pepper</li>
        <li>Fresh Parsley (optional)</li>
        <li>3 Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Butter</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Parsley</li>
        <li>½-1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

            <li>While sauce is thickening, heat another skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 3 Tablespoons of butter to the pan and let melt.  Place the chicken in the pan and sprinkle with garlic powder, parsley, and salt. Cook for 4-6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the chicken breast.  Cook until no longer pink. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
